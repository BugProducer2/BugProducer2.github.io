## improve

1. 把自己当成小学生，尽量用简单的词汇和语句把自己先表达清楚，积攒信心和流畅度。因为我本人讲中文表达能力还不错，就很喜欢把自己陷入“翻译”困境，先在脑内用中文想好要说什么，再对照翻译讲出来。常常会因为翻不出、不地道而沮丧。
   最好的方式是把自己当成语言能力有限的小孩子，不知道口水是saliva，就用liquid/water in the mouth；突然忘了palace，就用the place where the king lives/ the home of a king。母语者能够get到你在说啥，有时候会帮你把那个词找到，下次就记得且会用了。
   在一段时间之后，越来越准确、地道的表达的使用，就逐渐自然而然，甚至不用经过中文翻译这一步
