## Foreword

Given an example : How Bob and Davide check outputs of Alice are correct and followed the algorithm without re-execution?

- quick check (i.e., short and fast to verify)
- claimed output



Book constructions:

- definitions 
- building succinct proofs systems



## Preface

`Computation Integrity` 

`Why not re-execution ?`

> affordability & private inputs

`Properties of Cryptographic Proofs`

- succinctness : exponentially faster than re-executing
- ZK : reveals no information



`Applications`

- scalability : eg. the bottleneck of Ethereum, proof-based rollups

- privacy of highly sensitive information

### Scope

- full security proofs
- optimizations

### Why use ROM?

- Even though it's a strong model, it seems to offer more robust long-term security. (`really?`)
- Public-coin setup / transparent setup
